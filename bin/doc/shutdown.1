.SH NAME
shutdown \- safely shutdown or halt the system
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B shutdown
[\-f]
.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.B shutdown
command initiates a system power-off or halt.

It attempts multiple hardware-specific methods to power off the machine or virtual machine environment.

.TP
The
.B \-f
option forces a system reset if normal shutdown methods fail.

In virtualized environments, it tries VirtualBox and QEMU specific shutdown ports.

If the system cannot be powered off, it halts execution to prevent further operation.

.SH EXIT STATUS
This command does not normally return. It returns only if shutdown fails.

.SH EXAMPLES
Shutdown the system cleanly:
.RS
root@unics:/ shutdown
.RE

Force an immediate shutdown or reset:
.RS
root@unics:/ shutdown -f
.RE
