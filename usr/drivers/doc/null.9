.\" Manpage for NULL driver - section 9 (Kernel Developer Manual)
.TH NULL 9 "June 2025" "Unics Kernel Developer Manual" "Null Device Driver"
.SH NAME
null \- null device driver providing /dev/null functionality

.SH SYNOPSIS
The NULL driver creates and manages the special device file \fB/dev/null\fR.  
This device discards all written data and returns EOF on reads.

.SH DESCRIPTION
The null device is a special file that acts as a data sink.  
Any data written to it is discarded immediately, and reading from it returns end-of-file (EOF).  
It is commonly used for discarding unwanted output or as a data source that provides no data.

The NULL driver ensures \fB/dev/null\fR exists under the device filesystem, with standard read and write permissions.

.SH FUNCTIONS
.TP
.B null_init(void)
Initializes the null device driver by creating the \fB/dev/null\fR device file if it does not exist.

.SH IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS
Upon initialization, the driver checks for the presence of the \fBdev\fR directory and creates it if absent.  
It then creates the \fBnull\fR file inside \fB/dev\fR with read and write permissions.  
This file acts as the null device, consistent with Unix-like systems.

.SH ERROR HANDLING
If the \fBdev\fR directory or \fBnull\fR device file cannot be created due to filesystem errors, the driver will fail silently or log errors depending on the kernel's debug configuration.
